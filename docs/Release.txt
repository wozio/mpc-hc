Here is a quick how-to release a new stable build:

1) Update version and set the MPC_NIGHTLY_RELEASE define to 0 in "include/version.h"
2) Update "thirdparty/versions.txt" and the version/release date in "Changelog.txt"
3) Commit the changes
4) Make sure you have a clean source tree, no modified files, or unpushed commits
5) Compile MPC-HC and the standalone filters:
   a. CALL "build.bat" Clean All Both Release
   b. CALL "build.bat" Build All Both Release Packages
6) Keep the PDB files of all the filters and MPC-HC builds
7) Create a git tag for the new release
8) Upload the binary packages on SF following the directory and the packages names scheme
   (upload the PDB files too, use 7zip for creating the 7z packages)
9) Update the website with the new download links, changelog and version.txt with
   the new version number


In the next commit, set the MPC_NIGHTLY_RELEASE define to 1 in "include/version.h"
